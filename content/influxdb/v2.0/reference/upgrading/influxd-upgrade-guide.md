Use the `influxd upgrade` command to upgrade InfluxDB 1.x to InfluxDB 2.0.
This command copies all data stored in [databases](/influxdb/v1.8/concepts/glossary/#database) and 
[retention policies](/influxdb/v1.8/concepts/glossary/#retention-policy-rp) (used in 1.x)
over to [buckets](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/glossary/#bucket) (used in 2.0).

{{% warn %}}
Be sure to back up all data before upgrading with `influx upgrade`.

1. If you haven't already, [download the InfluxDB OSS 2.0rc1](https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads/).
   Follow the install instructions for `influxd` and `influx`.
2. Stop your running InfluxDB 1.x instance.
3. If your configuration file is at the default location (`~/.influxdbv2/configs`), run:

   ```sh
   influxd upgrade
   ```
   
   Otherwise, run:
   ```sh
   influxd upgrade --config <path to config file>
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to set up a new InfluxDB 2.0 instance.
